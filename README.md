# Imdb-Clone-Task

## Overview
As the name suggests, this task is about creating a movie database web application, just like IMDB using a modern stack. We prefer ReactJS and NodeJS. 
You can use any movie API service for the data sources. For your reference, listing a couple of services. 
You can signup in this service, obtain an API key, and use the REST API mechanism to fetch data.

* OMDB - http://www.omdbapi.com
* TMDB - https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api

## Task
### Part I - Movie Information Display
You need to create a web application, which should have a look and feel of [IMDB](https://www.imdb.com/). The web app should include a dashboard with displaying the latest/trending movies, artists and search features. All movies should show the movie title and movie rating along with the poster.
On click of any movie, it should open a page with which should display movie profile, cast and crew informaiton.


### Part II - New Movie submission
Create a page to submit new movie information, like title, genre, plot summary, poster, trailer (embedded youtube link), cast, and crew information. In this part only UI is required, it needs to be submitted to any backend and store the data. Only UI with necessary validations. For example, no special characters in the movie title and plot information. Poster file size and dimension checks. Cast and crew information can be up to 100. The movie budget should accept only numbers.


## Submission
Create a GitHub repository and email the link with your resume at hello@neoscript.in with the subject **IMDB Clone Task Submission | Your Name**.

Optional: You can also share the link of the hosted version of your app. Use [Heroku Apps](https://www.heroku.com/) for free hosting.
